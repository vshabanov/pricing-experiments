#+STARTUP: indent

* Local-vol, make sure mc/fem match bs with implied vol
** extend Expr with @if x ~ y then e1 else e2@
where we differentiate both branches.
We can then safely use SABR
** local vol at t=0?
* refactorings
** move solving and smile fitting to separate modules
** make market indepenent from the input type
* Implied vol smile calibration
** Better interpolation
RR interpolation is nonsence. Calibrate tenor smiles, then interpolate
standartized ATM, P25, C25 vols and solve smile for these vols and
corresponding strikes
** Add BF10/RR10?
** Market conventions?
* Pay on touch fem/mc? Stoping time?
* American FEM and monte carlo???
* Chooser? Asian? TRF?
* Different model (CEV, SABR, Stochastic, Mixed local-vol & stochastic)
* [MC] variance reduction
* Payoff dependent mesh grading
* [MC][parMap] Chunk jacobians, sumj . parMap grain=1 (jacobian . sum . Map pv path . Chunked gaussian)
will use less RAM even in single threaded case
* [MC] Check logspot (sigma...)<=log (barrier/spot), then we can s0*exp on the
last one to get pv
* [FEM] Check Greeks close to maturity and strike. Plot pv/delta vs spot on
diff maturities (with forward ad, might need -O3)
